Before we get started on building, publishing and deploying our NPM application, we must set up our workshop environment. In this setup section, we will:

- Set up our AWS account and IAM roles.
- Provision a Cloud9 IDE instance.
- Get and prepare our JFrog Platform instance.
- Get and Setup Pagerduty instance.
- Clone our workshop GitHub repository which contains our code.
