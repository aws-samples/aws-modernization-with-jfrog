Our CI/CD pipeline requires access to GitHub to pull our code, access to JFrog Artifactory to deploy our Docker image and access to AWS to deploy to ECS. We will set up JFrog Pipelines integrations to enable these.

{{% notice info %}}
An Integration connects Pipelines to an external service/tool. Each integration type defines the endpoint, credentials and any other configuration detail required for Pipelines to exchange information with the service. All credential information is encrypted and held in secure storage, in conformance with best security practices.

You may have already created these integrations in previous steps. If so, you can reuse them and do not need to recreate them. JFrog Pipelines allows you to share integrations and resources across pipelines.
