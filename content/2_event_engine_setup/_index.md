# Event Engine

Welcome to the Event Engine Setup section! This means that you are attending an AWS Hosted Workshop!! If you are not attending a workshop, please go to the [self guided setup section](030_self_guided_setup.html"). Event Engine is a tool created at AWS that provisions AWS accounts for workshop events like this! These accounts will automatically terminate 24 hours after the workshop begins participants don't have to worry about leaving anything on. Each workshop participant will receive their own Event Engine AWS account. 

Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

* Set up AWS account and IAM roles.
* Provision a Cloud9 IDE instance.
* Prepare our JFrog Platform instance.
* Install and configure the JFrog CLI.
* Clone our workshop GitHub repository which contains our code.

The next page will show you how to gain access to your Event Engine dashboard!
