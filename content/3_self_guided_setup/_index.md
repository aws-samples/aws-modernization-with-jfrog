# Self-Guided Setup

Welcome to the Self-Guided Setup section! This means you are doing this workshop by yourself, wherever you are! If you are at an AWS Hosted Workshop, please go to the [Event Engine setup section](2_event_engine_setup.html). The workshop track requires an AWS account where you will need to have an IAM user/identity that you can log into to set up the necessary AWS components to complete the workshop. Worried about costs associated with this workshop? Don't worry, go to the next page and request some AWS credits to pay for any costs that may be incurred through this workshop!

Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

* Set up your AWS account and IAM roles.
* Provision a Cloud9 IDE instance.
* Get a JFrog Platform instance from the AWS Marketplace.
* Prepare our JFrog Platform instance.
* Clone our workshop GitHub repository which contains our code.
