      <title>Create Your EKS Cluster</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/5_deploy_eks_pagerduty/52_create_eks_cluster.html</link>

      <description>We will use the EKSCTL command line tool to create an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes (EKS) cluster. This powerful tool allows you to manage many aspects of your EKS cluster through simple commands. When using EKSCTL, you can still manage your cluster in the Amazon EKS dashboard in the AWS console.
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.</description>

      <description>Next we will set up your PagerDuty Developer Platform. If you do not yet have a developer platform, you can sign up and get a free developer platform instance here.
PagerDuty provides many ways for developers to integrate with their platform. You can learn more through their developer documentation.
  In your PagerDuty, go to Services &amp;gt; Service Directory. A service may represent an application, component, or team you wish to open incidents against.</description>

      <title>Set up our JFrog Pipelines Integrations</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/5_deploy_eks_pagerduty/54_pipeline_integrations.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>//localhost:1313/5_deploy_eks_pagerduty/54_pipeline_integrations.html</guid>
      <description>Our CI/CD pipeline requires access to GitHub to pull our code, access to JFrog Artifactory to deploy our Docker image and access to AWS to deploy to EKS. We will set up JFrog Pipelines integrations to enable these.
An Integration connects Pipelines to an external service/tool. Each integration type defines the endpoint, credentials and any other configuration detail required for Pipelines to exchange information with the service. All credential information is encrypted and held in secure storage, in conformance with best security practices.</description>

      <title>Update our Pipeline</title>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/5_deploy_eks_pagerduty/55_update_pipeline.html</guid>
      <description>We need to make an update to our CI/CD pipeline in order to use your JFrog Platform instance. The CI/CD pipeline is defined in pipelines.yml. This pipeline file is parameterized with a values.yml file. We need to update this file.
 In your Cloud9 terminal, use the editor and view the pipelines.yml file. View and understand the steps. Note the parameterized values.  The last step in the pipeline, eks_deploy, deploys our application to the EKS cluster we created earlier.</description>
