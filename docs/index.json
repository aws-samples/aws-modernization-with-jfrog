	"content": "The goal of DevOps is to allow your development teams to deliver quality software faster to your customers through continuous process improvement, leveraging the best of breed development tools and infrastructure, and utilizing software development and IT operations best practices. Your team must deliver software faster than your competitors in order to get features and fixes to your customers sooner. JFrog terms this ideal as liquid software.\n Looking forward, as release cycles get shorter and microservices get smaller, we can imagine a world in which at any one time, our systems’ software is being updated. Effectively, software will become liquid in that products and services will be connected to “software pipes” that constantly stream updates into our systems and devices; liquid software continuously and automatically updating our systems with no human intervention.\n\u0026ndash; JFrog (2017), A Vision of Liquid Software, Retrieved from https://jfrog.com/whitepaper/a-vision-of-liquid-software/\n A critical aspect of DevOps is infrastructure. Cloud computing infrastructure has allowed DevOps to advance and come closer to realizing liquid software. Cloud computing has allowed development teams to build these software pipes by:\n Using ephemeral cloud infrastructure to scale their development process and software delivery at levels not achievable with on-premise infrastructure. Providing applications on a global scale with real-time response and resiliency. Leveraging new cloud services in their application and software development processes to improve the quality, security and delivery of their applications. Allowing multi-discipline teams to collaborate in the cloud across the software lifecycle to ensure quality, security, velocity and scale of applications.  "

	"content": "Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) is the process for which your software components are built from code, integrated, tested, released, deployed and ultimately delivered to end-users. CI/CD pipelines are the software assembly line that orchestrates the building of your software. This CI/CD pipeline line requires infrastructure. Cloud computing has allowed this infrastructure to become dynamic and ephemeral. On cloud infrastructure, your CI/CD pipelines scale up and down to meet your software delivery demands. It saves costs by providing the right amount of cloud infrastructure just as it is needed. This is further realized by using cloud-native technologies like Kubernetes and extending across clouds and on-premise datacenters. The following are some AWS cloud technologies that CI/CD pipelines can utilize:\n EC2 instances can be used as CI/CD pipeline nodes that can be dynamically spun up and down to execute pipeline tasks. EC2 spot instances can dramatically lower costs by utilizing spare capacity nodes for CI/CD pipeline tasks. Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) can provide a Kubernetes-based CI/CD worker node pools and allow more efficient use of compute resources. AWS Outposts can allow you to span your CI/CD pipelines from your on-premise datacenter to the cloud for hybrid and migration use cases.  "

	"content": "A Binary Repository Manager is a software hub that simplifies the development process for different teams across an organization by helping them to collaborate on building coherent and compatible software components. It does this by centralizing the management of all the binary artifacts generated and used by the organization, thereby overcoming the incredible complexity arising from diverse binary artifact types, their position in the overall workflow and the set of dependencies between them.\nSome of the many benefits of using a Binary Repository Manager are:\n Reliable and consistent access to remote artifacts. Reduced network traffic and optimized builds. Tight integration with build ecosystems. Custom handling of artifacts to comply with any organization’s requirements. Security and access control to artifacts and repositories. Manage licensing requirements and open source governance for use of software components. Distributing and sharing artifacts across an organization. System stability and reliability with high availability architecture. Smart search for binaries. Advanced maintenance and monitoring tools.  Cloud infrastructure has provided additional benefits. With the cloud, binary repositories can now:\n Enable replication and resiliency through the use of global data centers. Provide lower latency and improved network performance by being available closer to end-users. Provide their services at the edge of the network regionally and globally to edge devices. Utilize cloud storage for reduced costs, scalability and lower maintenance. Leverage cloud services such as security vulnerability databases to extend their functionality.  "

	"content": "Any security issue identified by a security scanning may be reviewed by a small security team that may lack the technical knowledge. This challenge can be reduced by shifting left to the developer and operations teams, making them also responsible for security and compliance. This moves security earlier in the software delivery process. Source code, dependency and artifact security scanning are some examples of moving security into the development process. Implementing the identification of security issues earlier in the CI/CD pipeline, as well as automating security and compliance policies in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), rather than using manual processes, is crucial. Moreover, organizations that leave the Sec out of DevOps, may face security and compliance issues that are closer to their release, resulting in additional costs for remediating such issues.\nAs you move your SDLC to the cloud, your DevSecOps strategy must also adapt to the cloud. As discussed previously, binary repository managers that scale globally across cloud data centers require DevSecOps tools that will likewise scale and adjust. An enterprise scale software delivery system with multiple development teams, end users and devices mean more entry points for potential security and compliance issues. Therefore, it is critical that your SLDC is well-integrated with your DevSecOps system.\n"
