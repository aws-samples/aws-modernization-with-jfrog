      <title>Set up our JFrog Pipelines Integrations</title>

      <description>Our CI/CD pipeline requires access to GitHub to pull our code, access to JFrog Artifactory to deploy our Docker image and access to AWS to deploy to ECS. We will set up JFrog Pipelines integrations to enable these.
![Pipelines Integration](/images/pipeline-integrations-diagram.png) An Integration connects Pipelines to an external service/tool. Each integration type defines the endpoint, credentials and any other configuration detail required for Pipelines to exchange information with the service. All credential information is encrypted and held in secure storage, in conformance with best security practices.</description>

      <description>We need to make an update to our CI/CD pipeline in order to use your JFrog Platform instance. The CI/CD pipeline is defined in pipelines.yml. This pipeline file is parameterized with a values.yml file. We need to update this file.
 In your Cloud9 terminal, use the editor and view the pipelines.yml file. View and understand the steps. Note the parameterized values.
 The last step in the pipeline, ecs_deploy, deploys our application to an ECS cluster using docker compose with a special ECS context.</description>
